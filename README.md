Earthquake Mapping

The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. From the USGS GeoJSON Feed page, we
select a JSON dataset to visualize. We create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the selected dataset based
on their longitude and latitude. The plot has the following attributes:
~Data markers reflecting the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color
~Popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked
~A legend providing context for the map data
